How to generate the data saved in this folder?

1. For cross validation and model-recovery (CV_3Fold):
1.1. Run all the .jl files in "src/Optimization_simulated/CV_3Fold/" to fit the parameters of different models to the simulated data (n_set = 1, 2, or 3) using 3-fold cross validation.
1.2. Run "src/Optimization_simulated/Coord_Asc_CV_Result_Analysis_4Parts.jl" and "src/Optimization_simulated/Coord_Asc_CV_Result_Analysis.jl" to process the results of step 1.1.

2. For fitting SurNoR to the whole simulated data for parameter recovery (Overall):
2.1. Run "src/Optimization_simulated/Overall/Coord_Asc_SurNoR.jl" to fit the parameters of SurNoR to the whole simulated data (n_set = 1, 2, or 3).
2.2. Run "src/Optimization_simulated/Coord_Asc_OverAll_Result_Analysis.jl" to process the results of step 2.1.

As a results, all the data in this folder would be re-produced.
